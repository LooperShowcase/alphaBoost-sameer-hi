        Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription streaming service and
        production company. Launched on August 29, 1997, it offers a film and
        television series library through distribution deals as well as its own
        productions, known as Netflix Originals. As of December 31, 2021,
        Netflix had over 221.8 million subscribers worldwide, including 75.2
        million in the United States and Canada, 74.0 million in Europe, the
        Middle East and Africa, 39.9 million in Latin America and 32.7 million
        in Asia-Pacific.[11] It is available worldwide aside from Mainland China
        (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, Russia and Crimea (due
        to US sanctions). Netflix has played a prominent role in independent
        film distribution, and is a member of the Motion Picture Association
        (MPA). Netflix can be accessed via internet browser on computers, or via
        application software installed on smart TVs, set-top boxes connected to
        televisions, tablet computers, smartphones, digital media players,
        Blu-ray Disc players, video game consoles and virtual reality headsets
        on the list of Netflix-compatible devices.[12][13][14][15] It is
        available in 4K resolution.[16] In the United States, the company
        provides DVD and Blu-ray rentals delivered individually via the United
        States Postal Service from regional warehouses.[17] Netflix was founded
        in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California.
        Netflix initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were
        eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business.[18][19] In
        2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The
        company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the
        Caribbean. Netflix entered the content production industry in 2013,
        debuting its first series House of Cards. In January 2016, it expanded
        to an additional 130 countries and then operated in 190 countries. The
        company is ranked 115th on the Fortune 500[20] and 219th on the Forbes
        Global 2000.[21] It is the second largest entertainment/media company by
        market capitalization as of February, 2022.[22] In 2021, Netflix was
        ranked as the eighth-most trusted brand globally by Morning Consult.[23]
        During the 2010s, Netflix was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500
        stock market index, with a total return of 3,693%.[24][25] Netflix is
        headquartered in Los Gatos, California, in Santa Clara County,[26][27]
        with the two CEOs, Hastings and Ted Sarandos, split between Los Gatos
        and Los Angeles, respectively.[28][29][30] It also operates
        international offices in Asia, Europe and Latin America including in
        Canada, France, Brazil, Netherlands, India, Japan, South Korea and the
        United Kingdom. The company has production hubs in Los Angeles,[31]
        Albuquerque,[32] London,[33] Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto.[34] Compared
        to other distributors, Netflix pays more for TV shows up front, but
        keeps more "upside" (i.e. future revenue opportunities from possible
        syndication, merchandising, etc.) on big hits.[35][36]
